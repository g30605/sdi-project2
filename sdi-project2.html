<p>I chose to do a zombie themed story again this week for the fact of it build ability. By doing this theme I know that I'll have a good story next week too.  Zombies are fun to write about and the stories that come out of them can be extremely variable so its the perfect choice for me in the end.  Also I did a zombie theme last week and wanted to build of of it.</p>
<p>Zombies are essentially walking corpses.  They have a craving for human flesh and if they bite somebody then whether that person escapes or not, they will eventually die and also become a zombie.  There are many variations of zombies; slow ones, fast ones, dumb ones, and smart ones.  There are also many different ways that they can be made from viruses to hell being full.</p>
